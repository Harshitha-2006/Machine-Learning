Simple Linear Regression - House Price Prediction
📁 Dataset
The dataset (simpler.csv) contains two columns:
area: Size of the house in square feet (independent variable)
price: Price of the house (dependent variable)

📐 Model Equation
The learned Linear Regression model is of the form:
price=m*area+c

Where:
price — dependent variable
area — independent variable
m — slope (coefficient) of the line
c — intercept

📊 Learned Values from the Model
After training the model and predicting the price for a house with an area of 3300 sqft:
Slope (m): 135.7876
Intercept (c): 180616.44

🔢 Example Prediction
To predict the price of a house with an area of 3300 sqft:
price=135.7876*3300+180616.44≈$628,715.75
